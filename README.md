The game doesnt really consist of alot its just a basic choice based game with some cool effects, i used colorama to add color to the termninal and time
to make the text slower so it doesnt just teleport to the terminal when you run it and it adds a bit of life, i might continue this but im thinking of
merging the game with python and add objects so you can actually use weapons, abilities and fight enemies, or i might just make it a really complex escape room type game
with alot of text.
